    "# Predicting NYT Picks Comments\n",
    "The New York Times has a feature on its website called \"NYT Picks\" which is an effort by the 14 moderators on staff to select and highlight the most interesting and insightful comments that are submitted by readers. The selected comments are put in a separate user interface tab so that they're easier to find, and they get a little yellow badge which serves to highlight them further. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various editorial criteria that the Times' staff uses to decide which comments to publish and to select as NYT Picks. Some of the criteria used are described in this [article](https://www.google.com/#safe=off&q=http:%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Ftimes-insider%2F2014%2F04%2F17%2Fa-comments-path-to-publication%2F) (top link). Criteria used to decide to publish include: incoherency, political insults, profanity / obscenity, and insults or sterotyped condemnation. For NYT Picks they look for: high quality, broad representation, back and forth conversation, the unexpected, personal stories. Other criteria for editorial selection of comments that have been [developed from the research literature](http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ISOJ_Journal_V5_N1_2015_Spring_Diakopoulos_Picking-NYT-Picks.pdf) include argument quality, criticality, emotionality, entertainment value, readability, personal experience, internal coherence, thoughtfulness, length, relevance, fairness, and novelty. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we're goint to try to predict whether a comment should be a NYT Pick based on other scores that we use to make that prediction. We'll first develop a prediction framework, and then for rest of the workshop you'll work in pairs to code a new score based on the text of the comment that can be used in that prediction framework to improve the prediction. Toward the end, we'll combine all of our scores together and see if the combination of all our scores leads to an improvement in prediction accuracy.  "

    "- `articleURL`: the link to the article to which this comment was posted\n",
    "- `NYTPicks`: 0 or 1 to indicate whether the comment was selected as a Times Pick"

    "\n",

This allows us to develop a predictive model that *learns* the relationship between the input comment and the \"target\" or \"label\" which in this case is the NYT Pick status. This is called **supervised learning** -- the learning process is supervised in the sense that we're already given it the answer. The power of this of course is that once the learning process is complete we can use the model that was learned to apply it to *new comments* for which we don't yet know if it should be an NYT Pick or not. \n"

    "## Feature Development & Selection \n",
    "For classification to work we need to have some attributes, often called **features** which are used as predictors for the classification. Many of the editorial criteria described above may make good candidates, but let's start simple. To find possible features that may have some predictive power (not all features will), we might start by doing a bit of exploratory analysis. Lets see how the mean and median recommendation count varies between comments that were picked and those that weren't."

We'll just use a very basic algorithm in this case called **logistic regression**. You may have encountered regression before in stats class.
