# Immersive Automation ML Workshop, Helsinki 2018

Today we're going to use machine learning to make predictions about online comments. Online comment curation is a task that online news sites often struggle with. Using machine learning can help moderators scale-up their ability to identify and remove low quality comments, or identify and highlight high quality comments. 

Background
- This tutorial assumes you have some basic knowledge of how to read and edit Python code. It uses Pandas as a data manipulation library, and Scikit Learn as the machine learning library. 

Downloads
- Let's make sure our computers are setup first. If you haven't already, download and install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos
- Download the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/comp-journalism/immersive-automation-ml-workshop/blob/master/Comments-prediction-skeleton.ipynb)  for our project to a local folder on your computer. (Click the link and then download the version of the file using the "Raw" button)
- Download the data we're going to use for training and testing our machine learning. Save the [data file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zvr0voq32xtbns8/comments-sampled.csv?dl=0) in the same folder with the Jupyter Notebook for the project. (Click the link and then download from Dropbox)

Getting Going
- Once you have Anaconda installed, launch a Jupyter Notebook using the Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface. 
- In the Jupyter Notebook navigate to the downloaded notebook for the project and open it. Instructions continue there ...
